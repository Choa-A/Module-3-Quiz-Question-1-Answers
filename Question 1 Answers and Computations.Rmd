**The life in hours of a battery is known to be approximately normally distributed with standard deviation σ=1.25 hours. A random sample of 10 batteries has a mean life of $\bar{x}=40.5$ hours.**

**B. What is the P-value for the test in part A?**

**C. What is the β-error for the test in part B if the true mean life is 42 hours?**

**D. What sample size would be required to ensure that β does not exceed 0.10 if the true mean is 44 hours?**

**E. Explain how you could answer the question in part A by calculating an appropriate confidence bound on battery life.**

## A. Is there evidence to support the claim that battery life exceeds 40 hours? Use α=0.05.

$H_0: \mu=40$

$H_1: \mu<40$

$\bar{x}=40.5$

$\sigma = 1.25$

$\alpha = 0.05$

$n=10$



*P-value*$< \alpha$*, then we reject *$H_0$

*P-value*$> \alpha$*, then we accept *$H_0$

$Z_0 > Z_{value}$*, then we reject *$H_0$

$Z_0 < Z_{value}$*, then we accept *$H_0$

We can look for the confidence level $C$

$$
C = 1 - \alpha = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95
$$

$$
Z^2 = \frac{\alpha}{2} + C = 0.025 + 0.95 = 0.975
$$

Look for $0.975$ on the table to look for the Z-Value.

$$
1+0.96=1.96
$$

Look for $Z_0$

$$
Z_0 = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}
$$

$$
Z_0 = \frac{40.5 - 40}{1.25/\sqrt{10}}
$$

$$
Z_0 = 1.2649 \approx 1.26
$$
$$
1.26 < 1.96
$$

$$
Z_0 < Z_{value}
$$

*Therefore, we accept* $H_0$

Use $Z_0 = 1.26$ in the table

Look for $0.975$ on the table to look for the Z-Value.

$$
z^2 = 0.8962
$$

Look for the *P-Value*

$$
P = 1 - z^2 = 1 - 0.8962
$$

$$
P = 0.1038
$$

$$
P_{value} = 2(0.1038) = 0.2076
$$

$$
0.2076 > 0.05
$$

$$
P_{Value} > \alpha
$$

*Therefore, we accept* $H_0$

**Final Answer:**

***Both tests shows evidence that support the claim that battery life exceeds 40 hours***

* * *

## B. What is the P-value for the test in part A?

***This was already answered in part A.***

$$
P = 1 - z^2 = 1 - 0.8962
$$

$$
P = 0.1038
$$

**Final Answer:**

$$
P_{value} = 2(0.1038) = 0.2076
$$

* * *

## C. What is the β-error for the test in part B if the true mean life is 42 hours?

*If* $\mu_2 = 42$

$\mu_1 = 40$

$\bar{x}_1 = 40.5$

$$
\bar{x}_1 - \mu_1 = 40.5 - 40
$$

$$
\bar{x}_1 - \mu_1 = 0.5
$$

$$
\bar{x}_2 = 41 + 0.05
$$

$$
\bar{x}_2 = 41.5
$$

$$
Z_1 = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \mu_2 }{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}
$$

$$
Z_1 = \frac{40.5 - 42}{1.25 / \sqrt{10}}
$$

$$
Z_1 = -3.7947 \approx -3.79
$$

$$
Z_2 = \frac{\bar{x}_2 - \mu_2}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}
$$

$$
Z_2 = \frac{41.5 - 42}{1.25 / \sqrt{10}}
$$

$$
Z_2 = -1.2649 \approx -1.26
$$

$$
Z_1 = -3.79 = -3.7 + (-0.09)
$$

$$
Z_2 = -1.26 = -1.2 + (-0.06)
$$

$Z^2_1 = 0.00008$

$Z^2_2 = 0.10383$

$$
\beta = P(Z_1 < z < Z_2)
$$

$$
\beta = P(-3.7947 < z < -1.2649)
$$

$$
\beta = P(-3.7947 < z < -1.2649)
$$

$$
\beta = 0.10383 - 0.00008
$$


**Final Answer:**

$$
\beta = 0.10375 \approx 0.1038
$$

* * *

## D. What sample size would be required to ensure that β does not exceed 0.10 if the true mean is 44 hours?

*If* $\mu = 44$

$$
\beta = Z^2_4 = Z^2_3
$$

Use two ***Z*** values in which their respective $Z^2$ will have a difference that is less than 0.10.

Image Source: <https://www.ztable.net/>

$$
Z_3 = -2.43 = -2.4 + (-0.03)
$$

$$
Z^2_3 = 0.00755
$$

$$
Z_4 = -1.24= -1.2 + (-0.04)
$$

$$
Z^2_4 = 0.10749
$$

$$
\beta = 0.10749 - 0.00755
$$

$$
\beta = 0.09994
$$

$$
Z = \frac{\bar{x}-44}{1.25/\sqrt{n}}
$$

$$
-2.43 = \frac{43.5-44}{1.25/\sqrt{n}}
$$

$$
 \frac{\sqrt{n}(43.5-44)}{1.25} = -2.43
$$

$$
 \frac{\sqrt{n}(-0.5)}{1.25} = -2.43
$$

$$
\sqrt{n} = 6.075
$$

$$
n = 36.91
$$

**Final Answer:**

$$
n \approx 37
$$

## E. Explain how you could answer the question in part A by calculating an appropriate confidence bound on battery life.

***This was already answered in part A ... again.***

$$
\alpha = 0.05
$$

$$
C = 1 - \alpha = 1 - 0.05
$$

**Final Answer:**

$$
C = 0.95
$$
